# Trimui Smart RGH Tomato (release v1.5.3) 23/01/2023 

## NEW OPTION TO UPDATE

Auto-Update Working!

On the first boot after extracting the zip over and overwriting, the boot will take longer as it's deleting unnecessary files, and moving some to the correct locations.


## Instructions

1) Extract the zip file to the root of your sd card preformatted to fat32.

2) Add your roms in the apropriate Roms folders and all the artwork in Imgs folder on root in the apropriate folders that have been pre created.

3) Please make sure you have the corect bios files in place for systems to work. Please place your bios files in SDcard/Bios
