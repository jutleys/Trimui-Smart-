===============================
Clock Adjuster for TRIMUI smart
===============================

This tool simply sets the clock and is based on Clockd with the resident functionality removed
If you do not need to change the clock at any time, this is simpler to use

If WIFI is connected, date/time is adjusted to NTP server(time.google.com) at startup
If you use this feature, be sure to edit "timezone.txt" file to your region's value
(Write just +/- and numerical value, excluding "UTC")

Save the timestamp as clock.txt and refer to it at the next launch

Button functions:

LEFT  or L	... Move setting item to left
RIGHT or R	... Move setting item to right
UP		... Decrease item -1
DOWN		... Increase item +1
Other buttons	... Exit
