==================================
Screenshot daemon for TRIMUI smart
==================================

Once launched, the program is resident and screenshots can be taken into SDCARD/Screenshots by pressing MENU+L+R.
To release, run it again.

LED blinks momentarily while a screenshot is being taken.

MENU+L+R may not be a good idea, as the menu may appear, but I couldn't think of any other good ideas ;)
The order in which 3 buttons are pressed is irrelevant, so if the action of the MENU button gets in the way, try pressing MENU last.
