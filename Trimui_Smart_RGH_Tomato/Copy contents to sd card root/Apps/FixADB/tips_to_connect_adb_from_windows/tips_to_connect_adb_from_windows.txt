3. overwrite "Trimui Smart Factory Flasher/Drivers/ADB_Driver/android_winusb.inf" with "android_winusb.inf" in this archive
4. overwrite "/etc/init.d/adbd" in smart with "adbd" in this archive with Commander
5. after overwriting, turn off smart, connect USB to PC and turn it on
6. open device manager and install driver from unrecognized device by specifying ADB_Driver folder above
7. now you can "adb shell" from console (adb.exe is included in Trimui Smart Factory Flasher, latest is here https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools )
8. you can also use webadb https://app.webadb.com/ (note that after using adb from console, you must run "adb kill-server" before using webadb)
