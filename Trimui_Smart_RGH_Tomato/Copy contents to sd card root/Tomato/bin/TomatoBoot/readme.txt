Bootlogo Changer for Trimui Smart, adapted from Eggs' A66 version

usage: Launch your preferred [bootscreen.sh] from commander, or use the boot changer in apps for the tomato one. Can be modified as needed. 

This script writes .bmp file with the same name as itself as bootlogo.
So, if filename is logo.sh, logo.bmp will be written.

If you want to make a custom logo, make sure the bmp format is same and filesize does not exceed 512K. Images must be rotated ccw 90* and have the bottom to the right. 
BMPs must be- 320x240 16bit R5 G6 B5 < 524,288 bytes


If you softbrick your device with a bad image, just reflash it with the firmware. I have included some of mine to get you started.

Happy boot screening,
